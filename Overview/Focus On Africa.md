# Motivation {#FocusOnAfrica-Motivation}

Are we just another exchange, another decentralized exchange? No we exist to offer the one service that has been overlooked in the ongoing blockchain revolution. We offer a free and easy token listing for Africa based blockchain projects. We offer a secure platform for global traders to trade African Crypto Assets.

As of June 2018, listing fees on any of the top 10 crypto exchanges ranged anywhere between $7M to $10M, a cost that most projects canâ€™t cover instantly thereby limiting their potential reach and scalability.By prioritizing African based projects we believe we are leveling  the growth opportunities for scalability.

* Users can install their own matcher by installing the Tesrab software and enabling the matching functionality.
* The Matcher earns fees from the services it provides, so you can substantially increase your mining revenues.
* When a user sends an order to Matcher he doesn't transfer ownership of his money to anyone, his money remains on his account until the order is matched with counter-order.
