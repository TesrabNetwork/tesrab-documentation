# Token Listing Guidelines 
 Tesrab DEX is a real-time decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, providing traders a straightforward interface with the robust security of a decentralized network. Please read the following guidelines regarding our token submission and review process:  

# Token Submission 
 Simply visit the IDEX Token Request Form and provide us your token name, address, precision, website and other pertinent information.    
 
 # Token Review 
 Once you have submitted your token to IDEX, we will carry out a careful review of your platform, technology, and team. When evaluating a token, we look for the following: 
 
# An active community
 It is important to show traction in the market. An engaged, active community of followers can be a good indication of a product’s strength. Robust, updated code The quality of the development work and smart contracts underlying a token are paramount. We check GitHub and other sources to verify this. In-place funding It is important for businesses offering token platforms to have a source of revenue or other capital to guarantee their ability to carry on day-to-day operations and execute growth strategies. Funding can come from existing revenues, venture backing/fundraising, or a combination of the two. A strong team with a demonstrated track record  This is arguably the most important consideration. The team is ultimately the driver of success for any business, and we place a great deal of importance on its background and capabilities. 
 
# Token Listing 
 If your token meets the criteria listed above and is accepted by our team, it will be listed on IDEX within two weeks of submission (or sooner). Due to high demand, we are unable to respond to each submission individually. However, each new token listing will be announced via Twitter where we will tag your project to notify you.  
 
***Please note: Tesrab DEX reserves the right to reject any token submission. If your token is not listed and you have not heard from our team within two weeks of submission, you likely did not meet our listing criteria. Badgering our team via Twitter, Reddit, Telegram etc. will not increase your chances of being listed on IDEX.  
  
What if My Token Did Not Get Listed? 
 If your token is not listed within two weeks of submission, it is safe to assume you did not meet our token review criteria. Again, we are not able to respond or provide details on an individual project basis due to current levels of demand.   
 Don’t worry, you may re-submit a token for review if you have made material improvements to the technology, underlying business model, team or other criteria. However, we ask that you wait at least eight (8) weeks before re-submitting; any new attempts within this window will be rejected automatically.  
 Re-submission is no guarantee of acceptance.
